ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .idea/
* .idea/.gitignore
* .idea/libraries/
* .idea/libraries/tbs_sdk_thirdapp_v2_6_0_1045_36900_sharewithdownload_obfs_20161207_162008.xml
* .idea/misc.xml
* .idea/modules.xml
* .idea/workspace.xml
* README.md
* S-Browser-master.iml
* apk/
* apk/S-Browser_v1_1.apk
* ic_launcher-web.png
* pic/
* pic/1.png
* pic/2.jpg
* pic/3.png
* pic/GIF.gif
* pic/device-2017-01-06-103054.png
* pic/device-2017-01-06-103155.png
* pic/download.png
* pic/ic_launcher.png

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/armeabi/liblbs.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/liblbs.so
* libs/armeabi/libzbar.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libzbar.so
* libs/tbs_sdk_thirdapp_v2.6.0.1045_36900_sharewithdownload_obfs_20161207_162008.jar => app/libs/tbs_sdk_thirdapp_v2.6.0.1045_36900_sharewithdownload_obfs_20161207_162008.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* proguard-project.txt => app/proguard-project.txt
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
